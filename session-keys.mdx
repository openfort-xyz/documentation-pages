# Session Keys

Openfort uses session keys for securing player accounts while improving the overall gaming experience.
Session keys can be used to authenticate players, authorize their actions within the game, and grant limited permissions to their web3 accounts.

## Overview

Openfort has developed a robust internal infrastructure for handling session keys, ensuring secure and seamless player authentication. Moreover, you can find [client libraries](/libraries) for all major game developmentn platforms to help you manage the session keys.

Session keys are cryptographic key-pairs used to establish a secure connection between a player's device and their web3 account.
They are generated in the client-side and are used to authenticate requests from the player. The public key is used to derive an address, used to register the new session key. The private key never leaves the users' device.

Session keys are short-lived and typically expire after a certain period of inactivity or when the player logs out.

To better understand how session keys work on Openfort, you can read our blog post [Technical Dive: Session Keys](https://www.openfort.xyz/blog/technical-dive-session-keys).

The typical flow for session keys is as follows:

<div align="center">
  <img alt="session-registration-sign" src="https://strapi-oube.onrender.com/uploads/session_key_walkthrough_ff19816585.svg" width="75%" height="75%"/>
</div>

After this initial flow, the session key can be used to authenticate requests from the player.

## Quickstart

This guide will go though all the necessary steps to register a session key and then use it to mint an asset with the players' web3 account.
This example will follow the steps to register a session key on the browser, but the same steps can be followed on any other client-side application.

### 1. Create a session key - <span className='mr-2 dark:bg-gray-400/10 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-sm p-1 text-xs'>Client side</span>

After you have authenticated your user with your regular authentication system, you can create a session key for them. 
To create a session key, you need to generate a key pair on the client-side and send the address computed from the public key to your server.

Using one of the official Openfort [client libraries](/libraries) everything is handled for you.

<CodeGroup title="Install Openfort.js" label={'Command line'}>
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'Openfort.js' }}
  npm install @openfort/openfort-js --save
  ```
</CodeGroup> 

<CodeGroup title="Initialize Openfort" label={'index.js'}>
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'index.js' }}
  import { Openfort } from '@openfort/openfort-js';
  const openfort = new Openfort('pk_test_...');
  openfort.createSessionKey();
  await openfort.saveSessionKey();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

After creating and storing the session key, you can go ahead and register it.

### 2. Register a session key - <span className='mr-2 dark:bg-gray-400/10 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-sm p-1 text-xs'>Server side</span> <span className='mr-2 dark:bg-gray-400/10 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-sm p-1 text-xs'>Client side</span>

To register a session key, first send the address from the session key to your server.
You can get the address from the session key object created above like this:
<CodeGroup title="Get address from session key" label={'index.js'}>
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'index.js' }}
  const address = openfort.sessionKey.address;
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Then, from your server you can make a request to the Openfort API or use one of our [server libraries](/libraries) to register the session key.

<CodeGroup title="Install Openfort" label={'Command line'}>
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'Node.js' }}
  npm install @openfort/openfort-node --save
  ```
</CodeGroup>



<CodeGroup title="Initialize '@openfort/openfort-node' wih your secret key" label={'Node.js'}>
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'Node.js' }}
  import Openfort from "@openfort/openfort-node";
  const openfort = new Openfort('sk_test_...');
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The created session key would be valid since the 25th of May 2023 at 7:50 GMT (timestamp `1685001000`) and last for 1 hour (timestamp `1685001000`).
For a useful resource to calculate timestamps online, visit [UNIX Timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/).

Note how the `external_owner_address` parameter is used to indicate the address of owner of the account that will be created under the specified player. It's only necessary to specify this parameter when the player is doesn't yet have an account in that chain.

Also, note how a `policy` is used to indicate the policy that will be used to sponsor the gas fees of the transaction to register the session key.


<CodeGroup title="Register the session key using Openfort" label={'node.js'} label="/v1/sessions" tag="POST">
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
  curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/sessions \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
    -d player=pla_... \
    -d address="0x76e6...9341" \
    -d chain_id=80001 \
    -d valid_until=1685004600 \
    -d valid_after=1685001000 \
    -d external_owner_address="0x41e6...9341"; \
    -d policy=pol_...
  ```
 ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'Node.js' }}
  const session_key_address = "0x76e6...9341"
  const policy_id = "pol_..."
  const player_id = "pla_..."
  const valid_until = 1685001000;
  const valid_after = 1685001000;
  const chain_id = 80001;
  const external_owner_address = "0x41e6...9341";
  const playerSession = await openfort.players.createPlayerSession(
    player_id,
    session_key_address,
    chain_id,
    valid_until,
    valid_after,
    policy_id,
    external_owner_address
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>


### 3. Sign the session key - <span className='mr-2 dark:bg-gray-400/10 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-sm p-1 text-xs'>Client side</span>

The owner of the account of the player needs then to authorize the new session key.

To do so, it needs to sign the `user_op_hash` from the `next_action` object returned by the API call to register the session key.

<CodeGroup title="next_action response object from transaction_intents">
  ```bash
  "next_action": {
      "type": "sign_with_wallet",
      "payload": {
          "user_op": {
              "sender": "0x32a03030Cf534F299492a91cdeef5eD6A98558e2",
              ...},
          "user_op_hash": "0x91b4efe3648c79467f7b50aa9bb1b4eae383a52dd6d741d39ece29ed2ef8362d"
      }
  },
  ``` 
</CodeGroup>

Once the content of the `next_action` parameter above is signed by the owner of the account,
it has to be sent to Openfort using the endpoint `/v1/sessions/:id/signature` as shown below:

<CodeGroup title="Sign and send the session key registration" label={'index.js'}>
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
  curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/sessions/ses_.../signature \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" \
    -d signature="xyz..."
  ```
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'index.js' }}
  await openfort.loadSessionKey()
  await openfort.sendSignatureSessionRequest(
    playerSession.id,
    SIGNED_USED_OP_HASH,
  );
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### 4. Using the session key - <span className='mr-2 dark:bg-gray-400/10 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-sm p-1 text-xs'>Server side</span> <span className='mr-2 dark:bg-gray-400/10 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-sm p-1 text-xs'>Client side</span>

After the session key is registered, it can be used to authenticate requests from the player.
Whenever you create a transaction intent from your backend, a signature will be needed from the session key or owner of the players' web3 account.

<CodeGroup title="Create a transaction intent" label={'Node.js'}>
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'Node.js' }}
  const player_id = "pla_..."
  const policy_id = "pol_..."
  const contract_id = "con_..."
  const chain_id = 80001
  const optimistic = true;

  const interaction: Interaction = {
    contract: contract_id,
    functionName: "mint",
    functionArgs: [player_id],
  };
  const transactionIntent =
    await openfort.transactions.createTransactionIntent(
      player_id,
      chain_id,
      optimistic,
      [interaction],
      policy_id
    );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

After creating the transaction intent, the session key will need to sign the next_action `user_op_hash` and send it to Openfort.

<CodeGroup title="Load session key and sign a transaction intent" label={'index.js'}>
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'index.js' }}
  await openfort.loadSessionKey()
  const sessionSignedTransaction = openfort.signMessage(
    collectResponseJSON.data.nextAction.payload.user_op_hash
  );
  const openfortTransactionResponse =
    await openfort.sendSignatureTransactionIntentRequest(
      collectResponseJSON.data.id,
      sessionSignedTransaction
    );
  ```
</CodeGroup>
