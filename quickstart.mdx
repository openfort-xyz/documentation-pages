# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Openfort API. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Openfort API, you will need to grab your
  API key from your dashboard. You can find it under [Settings &raquo;
  API](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/apikeys).
</Note>

## Choose Your Client

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, Openfort offers clients for JavaScript, Unity, and Unreal. In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

<CodeGroup >
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
  # cURL is most likely already installed on your machine
  curl --version
  ```

  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'Node.js' }}
  // Install the Openfort Node SDK
  npm install @openfort/openfort-node --save
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/libraries"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Check out our list of first-party SDKs"
  />
</div>

## Making Your First API Request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Openfort API.
Below, you can see how to send a `GET` request to the `players` endpoint to get a list of all your players.
In the `cURL` example, results are limited to ten players.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/players">
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
  curl -G https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/players \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
    -d limit=10
  ```

  ```js {{ title: 'Node.js' }}
  import Openfort from '@openfort/openfort-node'

  const openfort = new Openfort(YOUR_SECRET_KEY)

  await openfort.players.getPlayers()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/api/players"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Read the docs for the players endpoint"
  />
</div>

<Note>
  <strong>Tip</strong>
  <br /> When using cURL, you can setup an env variable `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your secret key. Then, the command above will work out of the box.
