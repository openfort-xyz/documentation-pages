# Transfer Account Ownership

With Openfort, you can change the ownership of an account from one address to another. 
Finally, your players can take ownership of their account without ever having to go through exposing a private key.
Secure, frictionless, and easy.

## Overview

The never ending battle between security and usability is a constant in the blockchain space. 
Specially when it comes to account ownership and custody.

Openfort solves this problem by offering a flexible custody model that allows for a secure and frictionless way of transfering account ownership.

There are 2 steps involved in transfering account ownership:

- transferOwnership: starts the ownership transfer of the contract to a new account. Called through the API and performed by Openfort.
- acceptOwnership: the new owner accepts the ownership transfer. Performed in the client side by the new owner.

### How Transfer Ownership Works

Openfort accounts implement [Ownable2Step](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#Ownable2Step) from [Openzeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) to create a secure way of transfering account ownership.

You can check out the code that allows for this behaviour in their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol).

## Quickstart

This guide will go though all the necessary steps to transfer account ownership.

### 1. Set up Openfort - <span className='mr-2 dark:bg-gray-400/10 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-sm p-1 text-xs'>Server side</span>

Use our official libraries to access the Openfort API from your application:

<CodeGroup title="Install Openfort" label={'Command line'}>
  ```bash {{ title: 'Command line' }}
  npm install @openfort/openfort-node --save
  ```
</CodeGroup>


<CodeGroup title="Initialize '@openfort/openfort-node' wih your secret key" label={'index.js'}>
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'Node.js' }}
  const openfort = require('@openfort/openfort-node')('sk_test_...');
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Request transfer ownership - <span className='mr-2 dark:bg-gray-400/10 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-sm p-1 text-xs'>Server side</span>

Openfort will performa  [`transferOwnership`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#Ownable2Step-transferOwnership-address-) operation to transfer the ownership of the account from the current owner to the new owner.

The `policy` parameter is a policy that will be used to sponsor the transaction. 
You can find more information about policies in our [documentation](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api/policies).
Bear in mind this policy needs to have a `account_functions` policy rule to allow the sponsorship of this operation.

<CodeGroup title="Request transfer ownership" tag="POST" label="/v1/players/:id/transfer-ownership">
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
  curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/players/pla_.../transfer-ownership \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
    -d chain_id=80001 \
    -d new_owner_address="0x416c...354D" \
    -d policy="pol_..."
  ```
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'Node.js' }}
  const playerId = "pla_...";
  const policy = "pol_...";
  const chainId = 80001;
  const newOwnerAddress = "0x416c...354D";
  const playerTransferOwnership = await openfort.players.transferAccountOwnership({
      playerId: playerId,
      policy: policy,
      chainId: chainId,
      newOwnerAddress: newOwnerAddress,
    });
  ``` 
</CodeGroup>

### 3. Accept account ownership - <span className='mr-2 dark:bg-gray-400/10 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-sm p-1 text-xs'>Client side</span>


Using [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) React hooks, you can accept the account ownership by performing an [`acceptOwnership`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#Ownable2Step-acceptOwnership--) operation.

Find a working example of how to accept account ownership in our GitHub repository [component sample](https://github.com/openfort-xyz/samples/blob/main/ssv-social-nextjs/components/accept-ownership.tsx).

<CodeGroup title="Accept account ownership from client side" label={'index.js'}>
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'index.js' }}
  import {
    usePrepareContractWrite,
    useContractWrite,
    useWaitForTransaction,
  } from 'wagmi'

  const { config } = usePrepareContractWrite({
    address: accountAddress,
    abi: [
      {
        inputs: [],
        name: "acceptOwnership",
        outputs: [],
        stateMutability: "nonpayable",
        type: "function",
      },
    ],
    functionName: 'acceptOwnership',
  })
  const { data, write } = useContractWrite(config)

  const { isLoading, isSuccess } = useWaitForTransaction({
    hash: data?.hash,
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>
