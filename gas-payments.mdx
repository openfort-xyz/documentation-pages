  "In this guide, we will talk about how to use Openfort's gas policies. How players can send transactions on-chain paying fees with ERC20 tokens or even for free."

# Gas Payments

Gas payments on Openfort are managed by policies.
They enable you to define the contracts and/or functions that your users can interact with without incurring gas costs in native tokens.
By specifying these policies, you can control the way your players interact with the in-game items and currencies.

## Overview

By default, web3 users are responsible for paying their own gas fees.
However, with gas policies you can choose to sponsor transactions's gas fees or to let your users pay such fees in other tokens.
This document will guide you through the process of setting up gas policies to ensure a secure and controlled approach.

This opens up a world of possibilities, including:

- New users can perform on-chain actions without having to acquire the native network token first.
- Games can cover gas fees for their users to encourage adoption.
- Policies can allow users to pay for gas using a stablecoin like USDC or any other ERC20 token (ie. in-game token).
- You could sponsor actions that help your game adoption, but keep the payment of gas fees for actions required for leaving your gaming ecosystem.

## How Gas Policies Work

You can use gas policies to specify the contracts and functions that you want your users to interact with without paying gas fees in native tokens.

<Note>
  <strong>Add an asset contract</strong>
  <br /> To use contract policies, you first need to add your Asset Contract.
</Note>

To set up your first gas policy navigate first to the [Gas Policies tab](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/policies).
Then click on the top right button `Add Policy` to start filling the Policy Information.

### Types of Policies

There are two types of gas policies that you can implement:

- Pay gas for user: pay gas fees on behalf of your users using the native token (ie. ETH, MUMBAI, AVAC, etc.).
- Charge gas in custom tokens: the players can pay gas fees with any ERC20 token (ie. USDC, in-game token, etc.)

Select either all or some specific functions you want your policy defined above to apply.
