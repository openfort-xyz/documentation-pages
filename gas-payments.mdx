# Gas policies

Gas policies enable you to define the contracts and functions that your users can interact with without incurring gas costs. By specifying these policies, you can control the way your players interact with the in-game items and currencies. 

## Overview
By default, users are responsible for paying their own gas fees. However, you have the option to sponsor specific transactions or even cover all gas fees on behalf of your users. This document will guide you through the process of setting up gas policies to ensure a secure and controlled sponsorship approach.

This opens up a world of possibilities, including:

- New users can perform on-chain actions without having to acquire the native network token first.
- Games can cover gas fees for their users to encourage adoption.
- Sponsors can allow users to pay for gas using a stablecoin like USDC or any other ERC20 token (ie. in-game token).
- You could sponsor actions that imply an improvement on your game adoptions but leave it for users to pay actions that require leaving your gaming ecosystem.

## How gas policies work

You can use gas policies to specify the contracts and functions that you want your users to interact with without paying gas fees.

<Note>
<strong>Add an asset contract</strong>
  <br />To use contract policies, you first need to add your Asset Contract. This will automatically create a Gas Policy with default parameters that you can later modify.
</Note>

To set up your first gas sponsorship navigate first to the [Gas Policies tab](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/policies). Then click on the top right button `Add sponsor` to start filling the Sponsor Information.

### Sponsor Strategy

There are two types of sponsor strategies that you can implement:

- Pay gas for users: Pay gas fees on behalf of your users using the network token (ie. ETH, MUMBAI, AVAC, etc.).
- Charge gas in custom tokens: Either the game or the players pays gas fees with any ERC20 token (ie. USDC, in-game token, etc.)

### Spending Rules
When selecting `Allowed Transactions` you can decide what asset contract you want to sponsor transactions from.  

Then, select either all or specifics functions you want your policy to sponsor.

After add `Rate Limits` under the Policy model option. You can set up on or many limits. 

There are four types of rate limits:

- Amount: limit by the amount of gas
- Request: limit by the number of requests
- Gas Price: limit by the curren gas price
- Amount per txn: limit by the amount of gas per transaction

## Policy example
1. Sponsor up to 1 AVAX every hour for minting an in-game asset.
