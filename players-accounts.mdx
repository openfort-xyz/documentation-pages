# Players and Accounts

Learn how and when to create a player and their respective accounts using Openfort SDKs and APIs.{{ className: 'lead' }}

## Overview

This guide explains how to use Openfort to interact and manage your players and their accounts inside your game ecosystem.
When using Openfort, you must create a `player` for each individual that wants to use your game.
Each player can have accounts on different chains; they all will have the same public address.

### What are Players?

You create players every time a user signs up in your platform.
Players are used to identify users and enable them to interact with your game. Ideally, you want to create a player as soon as a new user signs up to your game and assing the newly created user with the `player_id` that Openfort returns.

<div align="center">
  <img alt="player-sign-flow" src="https://blog-cms.openfort.xyz/uploads/player_signup_105a5cab0a.svg" width="75%" height="75%"/>
</div>

Openfort provides a [backend SDK](/libraries) you can use. Otherwise, you can use the [API](/api) directly.


### What are Accounts?

Openfort accounts represent the [Ethereum account](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/) and they are used to manage the assets of a player. Players in Openfort don't have any account assigned to them when created. 

Whenever you want to create an account, you'll simply need to create it using a `player_id` and a `chain_id`. In most circumstances it's not necessary to create an account manually. Whenever you use that `player_id` to perform an on-chain action, Openfort will automatically create an account for you in the specified `chain_id`.

![AccountDecentralization.svg](https://blog-cms.openfort.xyz/uploads/Account_Decentralization_39a5c97ad7.svg)

The custodial sheme of that newly created account will depend on wether you provide the `external_owner_address` or not. When not provided, a custodial signer will be created for the new account.

<Note>
  <strong>Note: </strong>
  <br /> Even after creating a custodial account, your can convert it to non-custodial or self-custodial by transfering its ownership. Learn more at [Transfer Account Ownership](/transfer-account-ownership).

## Quickstart

In this guide you'll learn how to create a player, create an account for it and then mint an NFT.

### 1. Set up Openfort - <span className='mr-2 dark:bg-gray-400/10 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-sm p-1 text-xs'>Server side</span>

Use our official libraries to access the Openfort API from your application:

<CodeGroup title="Install Openfort" label={'Command line'}>
  ```bash {{ title: 'Command line' }}
  npm install @openfort/openfort-node --save
  ```
</CodeGroup>



<CodeGroup title="Initialize '@openfort/openfort-node' wih your secret key" label={'index.js'}>
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'Node.js' }}
  const openfort = require('@openfort/openfort-node')('sk_test_...');
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Create a Player - <span className='mr-2 dark:bg-gray-400/10 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-sm p-1 text-xs'>Server side</span>

Whenever a new user signs up to your game, you'll need to create a player in Openfort.

<CodeGroup title="Create a player" tag="POST" label="/v1/players">
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
  curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/players \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
    -d name="First player" \
    -d description="My First Test Player (created for API docs at https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api)"
  ```
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'Node.js' }}
  const player = await openfort.players.createPlayer({
    name: 'First player',
    description: 'My First Test Player (created for API docs at https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api)',
  });
  ``` 
</CodeGroup>


After creating a player, you'll receive a `player_id` that you can use from this point on to interact with the Openfort API.

### 3. Add the contract you want to interact with

Add [Asset Contract](/asset-contracts) to your game project. In this example, we'll use a simple [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) contract on the [Mumbai network](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/) deployed at [0x38090d1636069c0ff1Af6bc1737Fb996B7f63AC0](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x38090d1636069c0ff1Af6bc1737Fb996B7f63AC0).

<CodeGroup title="Add an asset contract" tag="POST" label="/v1/contracts">
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
  curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/contracts \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
    -d chain_id=80001 \
    -d address="0x38090d1636069c0ff1Af6bc1737Fb996B7f63AC0" \
    -d name="Simple NFT" \
    -d description="tutorial NFT asset"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This will return a `contract_id` that you can use from this point on to interact with the Openfort API. You can always identified by checking it's prefix `con_`.

### 4. (Custodial) Mint an asset with a Player - <span className='mr-2 dark:bg-gray-400/10 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-sm p-1 text-xs'>Server side</span>

<CodeGroup title="Create a transaction" tag="POST" label="/v1/transaction_intents">
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
  curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/transaction_intents \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
    -d player=pla_... \
    -d optimistic=true \
    -d chain_id=80001 \
    -d "interactions[0][contract]=con_..." \
    -d "interactions[0][function_name]=mint" \
    -d "interactions[0][function_args][0]=pla_..."
  ```
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'Node.js' }}
  const player_id = pla_...;
  const contract_id = con_...;
  const chain_id = 80001;
  const optimistic = true;

  const interaction: Interaction = {
    contract: contract_id,
    functionName: "mint",
    functionArgs: [player_id],
  };
  const transactionIntent =
    await openfort.transactions.createTransactionIntent(
      player_id,
      chain_id,
      optimistic,
      [interaction]
    );
  ``` 
</CodeGroup>

If you want to learn more about how transaction intents work, visit our [Execute Intents](/execute-transactions) guide.

### 4. (Self-custodial) Mint an asset with a Player - <span className='mr-2 dark:bg-gray-400/10 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-sm p-1 text-xs'>Server side</span> <span className='mr-2 dark:bg-gray-400/10 dark:text-gray-400 font-medium bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 rounded-sm p-1 text-xs'>Client side</span>

To create a self-custodial account, you'll need to provide the `external_owner_address` when creating the transaction intent.
If you don't provide it, a custodial account will be created instead.

<CodeGroup title="Create a transaction" tag="POST" label="/v1/transaction_intents">
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
  curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/transaction_intents \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
    -d player=pla_... \
    -d optimistic=true \
    -d chain_id=80001 \
    -d external_owner_address="0x3809...3ac0" \
    -d "interactions[0][contract]=con_..." \
    -d "interactions[0][function_name]=mint" \
    -d "interactions[0][function_args][0]=pla_..."
  ```
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'Node.js' }}
  const player_id = pla_...;
  const contract_id = con_...;
  const chain_id = 80001;
  const optimistic = true;
  const external_owner_address = '0x3809...3ac0';

  const interaction: Interaction = {
    contract: contract_id,
    functionName: "mint",
    functionArgs: [player_id],
  };
  const transactionIntent =
    await openfort.transactions.createTransactionIntent(
      player_id,
      chain_id,
      optimistic,
      [interaction],
      external_owner_address
    )?.body;
  ``` 
</CodeGroup>

The response of this request will contain a `next_action` object. 

<CodeGroup title="next_action response object from transaction_intents">
  ```bash
  "next_action": {
      "type": "sign_with_wallet",
      "payload": {
          "user_op": {
              "sender": "0x32a03030Cf534F299492a91cdeef5eD6A98558e2",
              ...},
          "user_op_hash": "0x91b4efe3648c79467f7b50aa9bb1b4eae383a52dd6d741d39ece29ed2ef8362d"
      }
  },
  ``` 
</CodeGroup>

Where you will need to sign the `user_op_hash` with the account you  specified in the `external_owner_address` field.
You have to then send the signed transaction back to Openfort.

To do so, you can either use our [client SDK](/libraries) or use our [API](/https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api/transaction_intents#sign-a-transaction-intent) directly.
In this demo, let's we'll be using the client SDK in a JavaScript environment. 

<CodeGroup title="Install Openfort.js" label={'Command line'}>
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'Openfort.js' }}
  npm install @openfort/openfort-js --save
  ```
</CodeGroup> 

<CodeGroup title="Initialize Openfort" label={'index.js'}>
  ```js {{ language: 'js', title: 'index.js' }}
  import { Openfort } from '@openfort/openfort-js';
  const openfort = new Openfort('pk_test_...');

  await openfort.sendSignatureSessionRequest(
    transactionIntent.id,
    SIGNED_USED_OP_HASH,
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The flow will look like this:

### 5. Conclusion

We now have a fully working implementation that allows us to mint assets for a player. Nevertheless, there are a two main disadvantages of this current implementation:

- **The newly created account will need to have native tokens to pay for the transaction fees:**

  We can use Openfort policies to sponsor transactions for our users. This way, we can pay for the transaction fees of our users. 
Learn how to use them at [Sponsoring Transactions](/gas-payments).

- **When non-custodial, the owner will need to sign each transaction introducing friction (e.g. pop-ups) to the user experience):**
  
  We can use Openfort session keys to create scoped session keys in client side. This way, we can sign transactions without UX interruptions.
Learn how to use them at [Session Keys](/session-keys).
