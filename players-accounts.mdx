# Players and Accounts

Create and manage players and their respective accounts using Openfort SDKs and APIs.

## Overview

This guide explains how to use Openfort to interact and manage your players and their accounts inside your game ecosystem.
When using Openfort, you must create a user (known as `player`) for each individual that wants to use your game.
Each player can have multiple accounts and each account can be of a different type (ie. EOA using Metamask, EOA using mobile, etc.)

## How Players Work

You create players every time a user signs up in your platform.
Players are used to identify users and enable them to interact with your game.
Each player can have multiple accounts associated with it.
You might create some accounts yourself, or you might enable access to account creation directly to your players in the Auth Page or player's settings.
With the Openfort's player endpoint you can create, update and retrieve payer details as well as seeing accounts under the `player's ID` and inventory.

## How Accounts Work

Accounts are used to manage the assets of a player. You can create multiple accounts associated with a player.
Each account created through Openfort is automatically assigned a managed wallet that has the ability to gaslessly interact with your game's currencies and smart contracts for the blockchains you use.
With the account endpoint you can list, create and retrieve the account.

Using additional accounts has a number of benefits:
- Allow players to onboard using different wallets.
- The ability to use assets from different accounts.

### Account Types

Openfort offers a complete flexible account framework that allows games to decide the way they want to sign up players
(from custodial to completely self-custodial accounts) and the operational responsibilities it means
(such as KMS, KYC/AML, etc). The beauty of Openfort accounts is the progressive "non-custodialization" of accounts.

This is entirely possible because Openfort offers smart contract accounts, meaning the address is completely independent of the 
key that manages it. As a result, it is possible to replace the key with another key, without changing the blockchain address of the account at all.

## Get Started with Players

In this guide, we are going to cover patterns on how to create players for your game. To start, make sure you have reveal your secret API key.

<CodeGroup title="Create a player" tag="POST" label="/v1/players">
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
  curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/players \
    -u YOUR_SECRET_KEY: \
    -d name="FrankMcCallister" \
    -d description="My First Test Player (created for API docs at https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api)"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Remember that a player can have several accounts. Therefore, we now need to create an account to interact with digital assets like minting or airdropping an in-game asset.

## Get Started with Accounts

<Note>
  <strong>Creating an account for your player</strong>
  <br /> 
  You can create as many accounts as you want for each player. However, the first account will be the "default" account used to execute transactions. 
</Note>

To create an account, you will need a `player id` and to define the chain where the account will be deployed. 

<CodeGroup title="Create an account under the player's ID" tag="POST" label="/v1/accounts">
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
  curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/accounts \
    -u YOUR_SECRET_KEY: \
    -d player="pla_42510499-0739-5813-bcf6-850bb91e935b" \
    -d chain_id=5
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Great! You created a player and associated an account to it. 

Note: Openfort's addresses are counterfactual, meaning you can use the same address into other EVM chains (ZkEVM is an exception for now).

## Get Accounts of a Player

Imagine that your player has associated more than one account with their `player_id`, for example:
- An EOA account (ie. MetaMask)
- A smart account (ie. Openfort social login)

You can retrieve the accounts associated to a player by doing the following:

<CodeGroup title="List player's accounts" tag="GET" label="/v1/players/:player/accounts">
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
    curl -G https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/players/pla_42510499-0739-5811-bcf6-850bb91e935b/accounts \
    -u YOUR_SECRET_KEY:
  ```
</CodeGroup>
