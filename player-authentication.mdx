# Player authentication

Openfort offers a "bring-your-own" authentification solution to handle your player authentication, registration and wallet connection flows.
As game owners, you have the freedom to choose what's the optimal configuration for your players and easily integrate with different auth providers.

## Overview

If you simply want to create blockchain accounts for each user, you can create custodial Openfort Wallets that are identified by unique identifiers (IDs) from your game.

## Signer agnostic account management

With the rise of wallet authentifications, there is an increasing demand for more convenient veriication methods. At Openfort,
we position outselves agnostics to the type of method used to verify the ownership of private keys. That's why we support methods that range from
a simple Key Management Service (KMS) to more complex split of keys with Multi-Party Computation (MPC).

Openfort will soon be ready to support many ways to crearte smart accounts. Here is a short list to choose the right one for you:

- If your game already have an existing Web2 account system and want to create account with user IDs.
- If you want to onbaord new user via socia logins.
- If you're already managing private keys and want to create wallets with the private keys.
- If you want to bring your own auth login experience and want to create accounts via RPC provider.

## Account flexibility

Openfort allows users to move from "care-less" to "care-full" scenarios. Starting from a smart account with only one signature.
