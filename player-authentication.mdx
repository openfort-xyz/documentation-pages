# Player Authentication

Openfort offers a "bring-your-own" authentication solution to handle your player's signup and login flows.

## Overview

There are two parts to every auth system:

- Authentication: who is this person that I am talking to?
- Authorization: once I know who they are, what are they allowed to do?

<Note>
  <strong>Note: </strong>
  <br /> Once you've decided your authentication flow, make sure to read more about [Authorization (Session Keys)](/session-keys).
</Note>

Openfort is designed to accept any of your preferred onboarding flows. You can authenticate your players in multiple ways:

- Email & password.
- Magic links (one-click logins).
- Social providers.
- Phone logins.

## How Player Authentication Works

Once you have decided, and implemented, one way (or more) to authenticate your game users, you should register them on Openfort by [creating a player](/players-accounts#get-started-with-players).
From that point, Openfort will handle the web3 account creation transparently for the players.

  <strong>Note: </strong>
  <br /> Traditional private keys can be used to authenticate smart accounts, and they are the ones with the most tools available.
</Note>

The ilustration below shows how Openfort accepts the registration of players using any kind of authentication mechanism.
Players that have informed their wallet addresses using a wallet provider (such as MetaMask) will be the ultimate owners of all their accounts used in the game.
Those players who use other web2-like authentication systems that cannot handle web3 accounts natively, will be leveraging Openfort's KMS system to auhtorize web3 actions.
In both cases, players are the real owners of the web3 accounts.

  <strong>Note: </strong>
  <br /> For the sake of efficiency, Openfort is not creating an actual web3 account until there is a transaction being pushed.
