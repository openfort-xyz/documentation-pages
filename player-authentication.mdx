# Player authentication

Openfort Auth offers a "bring-your-own" authentication solution to handle your player's signup and login flows. 

## Overview

There are two parts to every Auth system:

- Authentication: should this person be allowed in? If yes, who are they?
- Authorization: once they are in, what are they allowed to do?

Note: Once you've decided on your authentication flow, make sure to read more about [Authorization (Session Keys)](/session-keys).

Openfort Auth is designed to combine your preferred onboarding flow with Openfort accounts. You can authenticate your players in several ways:

- Email & password.
- Magic links (one-click logins).
- Social providers.
- Phone logins -Coming soon.

## How player authentication works

Note: Openfort is not creating an account until there is a transaction being pushed. 

Auth makes use of a server-side wallet to sign and verify JWTs. To create and/or a player's account you need a signer. A signer refers to any entity capable of cryptographically signing messages and transactions, which generally (though not exclusively) relies on an ECDSA private key. It is crucial to remember that the smart wallet's ownership belongs to the signer's owner. Consequently, ensuring the security of your signer is of utmost importance.

Traditional private keys can be used to authenticate Smart Accounts, and they are the ones with the most tools available.

If you're looking to use a Key Managemnt Provider bear in mind you'll also need to integrate with an authentication provider (ie. Firebase, Supabase, etc.)

## Account flexibility

Openfort Accounts necessitate the specification of one or more transaction authorizers during their creation. This requirement enables Openfort Accounts to verify that the intended owner is executing a transaction.

Select one or multiple owners for an Openfort Account:

- Single-factor authentication is the most straightforward method for authorizing Openfort Account transactions. With single-factor authentication, there is only one owner of an Openfort Account, an EOA, which can be either a Private Key or a Browser Wallet such as Metamask, Rainbow, or Coinbase Wallet.
- Multi-factor authentication offers the most robust way to authorize Openfort Account transactions. With multi-factor authentication, there can be numerous owners of an Openfort Account, chosen from a mix of EOAs and social accounts like Twitter, Google, and Discord, among others.
