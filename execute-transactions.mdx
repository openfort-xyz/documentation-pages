# Execute Transactions

In web3 gaming, managing transactions at scale can be a significant challenge.
Transactions are updates to data on the blockchain and are used in games for various purposes, such as adjusting player currency, granting items, and enabling crafting.

## Overview

Openfort transactions are executed from a smart contract wallet and they are referred as "transaction intents".
They are the way to send, track the status, and view details of each on-chain action.

Openfort has developed a robust internal infrastructure capable of handling over 10,000 transactions per second, per game.
This infrastructure includes automated systems for both gasless and non-gasless transactions, which are seamlessly managed through Openfort APIs when players interact with the game.

## How Transactions Work

Transactions are executed by sending an authenticated transaction intent to the Openfort API.
The transaction request contains the necessary information, such as the sender's address, recipient's address, and transaction data.
Openfort's infrastructure verifies the transaction request, updates the blockchain data accordingly, and returns a transaction hash as proof of the transaction.

<Note>
  <strong>Notice: </strong>
  <br /> In order to execute the transaction intents, the players' account should have native tokens in the network to pay for transaction fees.
  If you want to be able to sponsor transaction gas or allow players to pay them in ERC20, you can use a policy. Otherwise you'll see the error: AA21 didn't pay prefund
  <br /> Visit [Gas policies](/gas-payments) for more information.

## Custodial vs Non-Custodial

To execute a transaction intent via the Openfort API, players just need to send a transaction intent with the necessary details, such as the player, chain id, policy, contract to interact with and its required arguments.
- If the player is using a **custodial account**, no further action is required from their side. The operation will be processed by Openfort and it will be sent on-chain.
- If the player is using a **non-custodial account**, given that they are the only ones in possession of the secret key, they must approve the transaction. For that, they will receive a `next_action` with the information that Openfort wants to send on-chain. The player will need to sign it locally send it and send it using the `/v1/transaction_intents/:id/signature` endpoint. If signed correctly, this will successfully authorize a transaction intent for the assigned account.

As an example, let's execute a minting of an asset via a simple transaction API call.
If the player is using a custodial account, no further action is required and we can expect the minting to take place immediately after sending the following call:

<CodeGroup title="Create a transaction intent to mint" tag="POST" label="/v1/transaction_intents">
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
  curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/transaction_intents \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
    -d player=pla_... \
    -d chain_id=80001 \
    -d optimistic=true \
    -d "interactions[contract]=con_..." \
    -d "interactions[function_name]=mint" \
    -d "interactions[function_args][0]=0x63B7...484f"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

However, if the API call was performed by a player using a non-custodial account, the response of the call above would contain a `next_action` parameter like so:

<CodeGroup title="next_action response object from transaction_intents">
  ```bash
  "next_action": {
      "type": "sign_with_wallet",
      "payload": {
          "user_op": {
              "sender": "0x32a03030Cf534F299492a91cdeef5eD6A98558e2",
              ...},
          "user_op_hash": "0x91b4efe3648c79467f7b50aa9bb1b4eae383a52dd6d741d39ece29ed2ef8362d"
      }
  },
  ``` 
</CodeGroup>

Where you will need to sign the `user_op_hash` with the signer that owns the account of the player field.

Once signed, send the signature using the `/v1/transaction_intents/:id/signature` endpoint or use our [client SDK](/libraries).
The player's request must be authenticated with the publishable Openfort key (see `$YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in the request below).
For more information about Secret vs Publishable Keys, you can visit out [API keys docs](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/keys#api-keys).

<CodeGroup title="Sign a transaction intent to mint" tag="POST" label="/v1/transaction_intents/:id/signature">
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
  curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/transaction_intents/tin_.../signature \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" \
    -d "signature=0x9330...351c"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If signed correctly, this will successfully authorize a transaction intent for the assigned account.

## Transaction Types

### Simple Transactions
In Openfort, interactions in the blockchain are defined in the field `interactions` of the transaction intent.
The `interactions` field is an array of objects that contain the information of the contract to interact with, the function to call, and the arguments to pass to the function.

<CodeGroup title="Interactions within a transaction intent">
  ```bash {{ title: 'Interactions' }}
    -d interactions[0][contract]="con_..." \
    -d interactions[0][function_name]="mint" \
    -d interactions[0][function_args]="0x63B7...484f"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

As you can see, the `interactions` field contains the contract `con_` that has previously been added to Openfort.

Also, the function name defines the function to call from within the contract. If there exist more than one function with the same name, the function arguments will be used to determine which function to call.

Finally, the function arguments are passed as an array of strings. The order of the arguments is important and must match the order of the function's parameters.


### Batched Transactions

Openforts' smart contract accounts are able to execute multiple transactions in a batch.
With batched transactions, you can save time and reduce gas costs by submitting multiple operations at once.

To execute a batch transaction, you can send a transaction intent with multiple interactions.
Each interaction will be executed in the order they are received.
If any of the interactions fail, the entire batch will fail and no changes will be made to the blockchain.

<CodeGroup title="Interactions within a transaction intent">
  ```bash {{ title: 'Interactions' }}
    -d interactions[0][contract]="con_..." \
    -d interactions[0][function_name]="mint" \
    -d interactions[0][function_args]="0x63B7...484f" \
    -d interactions[1][contract]="con_..." \
    -d interactions[1][function_name]="mint" \
    -d interactions[1][function_args]="0x32B7...213d"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  <strong>Did you know? </strong>
  <br /> Batch transactions are also safer, thanks to a property known as "atomicity".
  <br /> This means that either all transactions within the batch will execute or none of them will, ensuring that your operations are executed seamlessly without any room for errors.
</Note>

<CodeGroup title="Example batch transaction intent" tag="POST" label="/v1/transaction_intents">
  ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
  curl https://api.openfort.xyz/v1/transaction_intent \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
    -d player="pla_..." \
    -d chain_id=5 \
    -d interactions[0][contract]="con_..." \
    -d interactions[0][function_name]="mint" \
    -d interactions[0][function_args]="0x63B7...484f" \
    -d interactions[1][contract]="con_..." \
    -d interactions[1][function_name]="mint" \
    -d interactions[1][function_args]="0x32B7...213d"
  ```

## Quickstart

We now have a fully working implementation that allows us to mint assets for a player. 
Nevertheless, there are a two main disadvantages of this current implementation:

- **The newly created account will need to have native tokens to pay for the transaction fees:**

  We can use Openfort policies to sponsor transactions for our users.
  This way, we can pay for the transaction fees of our users. 
  Learn how to use them at [Sponsoring Transactions](/gas-payments).

- **When non-custodial, the owner will need to sign each transaction introducing friction (e.g. pop-ups) to the user experience):**
  
  We can use Openfort session keys to create scoped session keys in client side. 
  This way, we can sign transactions without UX interruptions.
  Learn how to use them at [Session Keys](/session-keys).
